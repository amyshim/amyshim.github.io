            <p class="project-intro">
                Playlist Made Physical is an Augmented Reality iOS App that enables users to link songs to physical objects. The idea of adding music to physical objects stems from a desire to allow users to make associations similar to those made in human memories. Music, for many, triggers memories and emotions that often get lost in the translation to a playlist. Mapping the songs to physical objects, which trigger similar memories and emotions, may help preserve those connections.

        <p class="project-text">
            The initial concept of this project is inspired by Vannevar Bush’s visionary essay “As We May Think.” In the piece, 
            Bush pointed out that <span class="highlight">the way we typically store, organize, and consult information contrasts with the way humans “store” 
            memories in their brains.</span> “When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and
            information is found [when it is] by tracing it down from subclass to subclass,” wrote Bush in 1945. This is even more 
            prevalent in today’s society. Since the rise of computers, humans have begun to store more and more of their information 
            the way Bush described, in lists that are accessed via indexing. searching, or through some other hierarchical method.

            In our application, we tried to create a way for users to store their information which emulates human cognition. 
            Specifically, we chose to focus on music because music is also something that people connect with emotionally.

            After we have decided to focus on music streaming mobile application, we looked at the popular streaming services that 
            are on the market. According to the report from musically, the amount of music service subscriber has reached 309.1 million by 
            the end of 2019. Below is a breakdown of the different service providers.

            as library size and ecosystem.
            <br><br>
            We choose Spotify, Apple Music, and NetEase Music as the targets of this comparative study because of their unique commissions and features.

                    She uses Spotify’s both desktop and mobile version most of the time because she can find new release conveniently. She also uses Tencent Music because Spotify’s library doesn’t cover all the singers she is interested in, especially those sing in Japanese and Catonese.

        <span class="highlight">Another concept we have discussed is to store songs based on their geolocation information. </span>
        In terms of scale, we discussed making a world map, where people can store things to specific locations, 
        but we realized that this feature is not totally unique, as music streaming software has already categorized 
        and displayed songs based on their countries or regions. We also discussed the option of using a city or MIT 
        campus, where people can link songs to their home, classroom, gym, or jogging route, therefore creating a more 
        personal map of songs that connects to their daily experience.  This is something we would still consider adding 
        in after developing the 3d object recognition version.

        <span class="highlight">The third option is to use AR technology to scan 3d objects and attach playlists to each unique object.</span> 
        Through this way, we can attach additional information to physical objects that have their own unique histories, 
        stories, appearances, textures, and even smells. We decided this method is most directly related to our concept. 
        We didn’t feel the web-based app would bring in the physical world as much. More specifically, <span class="highlight">compared with the 
        first concept, in which isometric drawings are used to represent physical objects, AR enables users to interact 
        with physical objects directly, therefore eliminating the loss of rich physical features through the process of 
        translating them into digital drawings.</span> The richness of physical features is exactly what human memories or emotions 
        reply on or anchor to. In addition, AR is a new realm that is fun to explore. <span class="highlight">The geo-location application could work, 
        but we felt that locations are too general to evoke the same emotions as those triggered by physical objects.</span>

        While designing the AR app, we also looked at some other mobile applications that uses AR, especially object detection, 
        even though they are not related to music.

            and share Library with Apple Music. We made this decision because so that we can quickly code a technical prototype.

        The ability to associate music with different combinations of objects could be another feature to explore.</span> 
        For example, what if one could attach a playlist to a group of objects instead of just one? What if one attached a 
        Christmas playlist to many different Christmas ornaments, and then gave each ornament to a friend? Such grouping 
        would add an interesting extra layer to the levels of music organization possible.

        where people already are observing and experiencing the same space or object in different ways.</span> The app could be one 
        way to manifest all these different perspectives by allowing people to upload and share their own associations and 
        interpretations of a public exhibition, space, performance, etc.for the rest of the audience to see.
